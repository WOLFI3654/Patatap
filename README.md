# Patatap
A paperJS and howlerJS based project

A basic webpage which triggers a sound when a key is pressed. 

# Running the page

Just clone the repository and play with it. Cheers. :)

# Adapting

A new sound can easily be add.
Just append

	key: {

		sound: new Howl({

  		urls: ['soundurl']

	}
 to the data array
